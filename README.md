# Vite + React + React Router + React Query + Typescript + Eslint + Prettier + Stylelint + Tailwind

 A starter for React with Typescript and many default packages I would use to
 start a project. This is a work in progress and I plan to make changes over time.

The application is set up using the demo app provided in the [React Router
docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial), modified to use React
Router + json-server.

You can find more about these in the following links:
[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), 
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/),
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/),
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), and [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `pnpm install`

## Start

After the successful installation of the packages: `pnpm dev`. In another
terminal tab run `pnpm json-server` to start the json-server.
